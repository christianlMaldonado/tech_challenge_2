# iHeartMedia - Music Lab - Code Challenge

This challenge was designed to give iHeartMedia an idea of what point in the code spectrum I'm currently on.

Focused on human readability, then performance as a secondary factor.

Everything was written in JavaScript / Node.js, React.js, React Hooks, GraphQL, and AWS Serverless.

## Notes
- This app has **2 pages (views)**: ade using functional based components and hooks. No class based components.
- A landing Page
- React Router to allow the user to change the page they are viewing
- A page rendering a table displaying a list songs coming from the API
- Express is the server frame working the backend
- GraphQL has a eslint problem and in the moment to use time wiseley had to be cut from project
- Amazon serverless had a problem finding the yml file but is inlcuded in the repo to show it is there
- Installed and tested wit Jest! Although not able to use with JSX elements
