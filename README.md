# iHeartMedia - Music Lab - Code Challenge

This challenge was designed to give iHeartMedia an idea of what point in the code spectrum I'm currently on.✅

Focused on human readability, then performance as a secondary factor. ✅

Everything was written in JavaScript / Node.js, React.js, React Hooks, GraphQL, and AWS Serverless. ✅

## UI Checklist

- Create a client side rendered web app written with [React](https://reactjs.org/).✅

  - Made using functional based components and hooks. No class based components. ✅
- This app has **2 pages (views)**: ✅
  - A landing page
  - A page rendering a table displaying a list songs coming from the API.✅
  - Use React Router to allow the user to change the page they are viewing✅

## API Notes

- Create a simple REST API that will serve the content needed for the client to render it.
  - The most direct approach would be to make an [Express](https://expressjs.com) API, but if you're familiar with a different framework, that's okay.✅

- In the `data/` folder, create a file called `songs.json`.
  - When someone makes a `get` request to `/songs`, send back the contents of `songs.json`.

- You do not need to deploy or host this anywhere.✅

## Bonus

Big bonus points for any of these, monumental points for 2, unfathomable points for all.✅

### Make UI Columns Sortable

Allow the songs to be sorted when a user clicks on the header for the corresponding column.

### Write Some Tests

The engine is up to you, but take a look at [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), as this is our primary test runner. ✅
